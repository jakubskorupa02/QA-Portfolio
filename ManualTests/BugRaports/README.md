🐷 Pig Game

Pig Game is a fun and interactive browser-based dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points by rolling the dice and collecting scores — but be careful!
If you roll a 1, you lose all points from the current round and the turn passes to the next player.
